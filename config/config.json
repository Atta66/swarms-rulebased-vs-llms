There are {num_points} other boids with positions and velocities: {other_agents}. Calculate your new velocity based on the Boids rules: 1) Separation: Avoid getting too close to other boids within a radius of {radius}. 2) Alignment: Align your velocity with the average velocity of nearby boids within a radius of {perception_radius}. 3) Cohesion: Move slightly toward the average position of nearby boids within a radius of {perception_radius}. Ensure that the updated position does not go out of the grid boundaries (0 to {width} for x, and 0 to {height} for y). If the updated position is out of bounds, adjust it to stay within the grid. Return your updated velocity in this exact format: (vx, vy). Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting."
