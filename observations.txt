            Structure  
=================================  

JSON Input to PRS - what is read:  
  - Grid Size  
  - Number of Points  
  - Agent Prompts that use coordinates  
  - Background and Point Colors  

PRS Output to JSON - what is written:  
  - Coordinates  

Agent Workflow:  
  - Agents output the coordinates.  
  - These coordinates are saved in real-time to `config.json`.  
  - Saved coordinates are used by the next agent.

=================================  
=================================  
             Agents  
=================================  

Agent 1:  
  - Generates a specified number of points within the boundaries of the grid.  

Agent 2:  
  - Increments `x` and `y` for each point in the coordinates array:  
    - `x` is incremented by a random value between **15 and 30**.  
    - `y` is incremented by a random value between **30 and 50**.  

Agent 3:  
  - Resets `x` to **0** if it exceeds **500**.  
  - Resets `y` to **0** if it exceeds **300**.  

Agent 4:  
  - Checks each point in the coordinates array against all other points:  
    - If any two points are within a certain radius, move the point by **-50 in x**.

           Observations  
=================================  

Agent 1:  
  - Performs as expected.  

Agent 2:  
  - Does not work as intended:  
    - A single random increment value is selected and applied to **all points** instead of generating a unique increment for each point.  

Agent 3:  
  - Performs as expected.  

Agent 4:  
  - Partially works:  
    - Some points are adjusted as expected, but others are not.  
    - ChatGPT provided the following function, which is **not fully correct** for the intended behavior:  

### Provided Function
```python
# Define the list of points
points = [(47, 331), (247, 380), (162, 105), (137, 370), (44, 270)]
radius = 30
adjustment = -50

# Function to check if two points are within the given radius
def is_within_radius(p1, p2, radius):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2 + (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2) <= radius

# Check each point for neighbors within the radius and adjust x-coordinate if necessary
adjusted_points = []
for i, p1 in enumerate(points):
    adjust = False
    for j, p2 in enumerate(points):
        if i != j and is_within_radius(p1, p2, radius):
            adjust = True
            break
    if adjust:
        adjusted_points.append((p1[0] + adjustment, p1[1]))
    else:
        adjusted_points.append(p1)

Using the function works better than using the prompt.

=================================
=================================  
           Improvement  
=================================

Agents 2 and 4:
  - The issue arises because the prompt processes all points together.
  - **Potential Fix:** If the prompt handled each point separately, the logic would work as intended.
    - **Drawback:** This approach would require processing a large number of prompts, making it inefficient.
