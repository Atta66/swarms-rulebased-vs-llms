coordinates will give you as many coordinates that you generate in json file

"For each coordinate in {coordinates}, check if any other 
coordinate is within a radius of {radius}. If the distance 
between two points is smaller than the radius, adjust the 
x-coordinate of the first point by moving it -50 units.
Return the updated coordinates in the same format as the input, 
with no additional text."

what this does:

# Define the list of points
points = [(47, 331), (247, 380), (162, 105), (137, 370), (44, 270)]
radius = 30
adjustment = -50

# Function to check if two points are within the given radius
def is_within_radius(p1, p2, radius):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2 + (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2) <= radius

# Check each point for neighbors within the radius and adjust x-coordinate if necessary
adjusted_points = []
for i, p1 in enumerate(points):
    adjust = False
    for j, p2 in enumerate(points):
        if i != j and is_within_radius(p1, p2, radius):
            adjust = True
            break
    if adjust:
        adjusted_points.append((p1[0] + adjustment, p1[1]))
    else:
        adjusted_points.append(p1)

for each point, this will be better. more details.

all coordinates increment the same amount. I tried to change the prompt many times. Has to be done for each point.

Biggest observation, when it is a swarm: a lot of points, either unpredictable, or everything treated as the same.
